<h1>About</h1>
<p>
	This site is the final application in a Palindrome tutorial, a tutorial introduction to the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby programming language</a> that is a part of <a href="https://www.learnenough.com">Learn Enough.com</a>
</p>
<p>
	<em>Learn Enough Ruby to be Dangerous</em> is a natural prerequisite to the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em></a>, a book and video series that is one of the leading introductions to web development. <em>Learn enough Ruby</em> is also an excellent choice <em>after</em> the <em>Rails Tutorial</em> for those who prefer to start with the latter first.
